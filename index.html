            <p>dear mickey!!

<br><br>

happy 27th birthday!!! omg...that definitely means we‚Äôre in our late twenties now right? lol i don‚Äôt think we count as mid 20s anymore. that‚Äôs sad. but whatever life goes on. AT LEAST WERE STILL IN OUR TWENTIES! <i>yipeee!</i>

<br><br>

ok so i think i made the mistake of choosing to write this entire card. the thing is i don‚Äôt have a printer here....but whatever here goes nothing. i hope i don‚Äôt regret it and i hope you can read everything haha.

<br><br>

ANYWAYS; let us describe all the gifts shall we?

<br><br>

<b>BABIES CANDLE:</b>: Ok i‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve heard of this candle but all the youtuber seem to go crazy for it. i don‚Äôt understand why??? but i was curious and wanted to try it (i bought one for myself!) but i was actually disappointed when it came because 1) its a lot smaller than i thought - and dude it‚Äôs so expensive i don‚Äôt understand?? and 2) i also don‚Äôt understand because it just seems to be a regular candle lololol. but i‚Äôm excited to finish using it so i can use it to hold my brushes or something (what all you tubers do LOL)


<br><br>
<b>SOCKS:</b> I picked these up at muji (i also have the same ones) but after i wore them they‚Äôre a lot shorter and slide down a lot lol. maybe you won‚Äôt have that problem cuz you feet are smaller than mines?? haha


<br><br>
<b>SWEATER:</b> So i‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve heard of the brand everlane? i started looking at their stuff awhile back cuz i kept getting ads for them and then they finally opened a store in soho a month or so ago, and when i went he line was CRAZY LONG!!!! I didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre that popular?? but yeah a lot of people seem to know of the brand/shop there now! they‚Äôre known for like ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù clothes but more affordable. anyways i got this plain cashmere sweater cuz i thought you can‚Äôt go wrong with a plain and grey sweater lol. i also got one for myself üòÇ let me know if you need to change the size!

<br><br>

<b>PAGE BOY HAT: </b>lol no description required üòÇ 

<br><br>

<b>NATURE REPUBLIC:</b> hmm so i thought you can‚Äôt go wrong with face masks? i duno i just REALLY enjoy putting on face masks (even though i‚Äôve been lazy) but i find them so relaxing lol. 


<br><br>
<b>GIFT CARD:</b>b> lol!!!! so i jokingly got this but i thought you would appreciate it haha. it‚Äôs for you to use on your starbucks app and for all your mocha needs üòÇ hey the last time someone gave me a starbucks gift card i was actually really excited to treat myself every day lololol



<br><br>

<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND I HOPE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME YEAR</b> ‚ù§Ô∏è here‚Äôs to many more to come! (has it really been 7 years since we‚Äôve met?!?! my goodness lol)
