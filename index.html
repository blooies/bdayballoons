            <p>dear mickey!!

<br><br>

happy 27th birthday!!! omg...that definitely means we’re in our late twenties now right? lol i don’t think we count as mid 20s anymore. that’s sad. but whatever life goes on. AT LEAST WERE STILL IN OUR TWENTIES! <i>yipeee!</i>

<br><br>

ok so i think i made the mistake of choosing to write this entire card. the thing is i don’t have a printer here....but whatever here goes nothing. i hope i don’t regret it and i hope you can read everything haha.

<br><br>

ANYWAYS; let us describe all the gifts shall we?

<br><br>

<b>BABIES CANDLE:</b>: Ok i’m not sure if you’ve heard of this candle but all the youtuber seem to go crazy for it. i don’t understand why??? but i was curious and wanted to try it (i bought one for myself!) but i was actually disappointed when it came because 1) its a lot smaller than i thought - and dude it’s so expensive i don’t understand?? and 2) i also don’t understand because it just seems to be a regular candle lololol. but i’m excited to finish using it so i can use it to hold my brushes or something (what all you tubers do LOL)


<br><br>
<b>SOCKS:</b> I picked these up at muji (i also have the same ones) but after i wore them they’re a lot shorter and slide down a lot lol. maybe you won’t have that problem cuz you feet are smaller than mines?? haha


<br><br>
<b>SWEATER:</b> So i’m not sure if you’ve heard of the brand everlane? i started looking at their stuff awhile back cuz i kept getting ads for them and then they finally opened a store in soho a month or so ago, and when i went he line was CRAZY LONG!!!! I didn’t know they’re that popular?? but yeah a lot of people seem to know of the brand/shop there now! they’re known for like “good quality” clothes but more affordable. anyways i got this plain cashmere sweater cuz i thought you can’t go wrong with a plain and grey sweater lol. i also got one for myself 😂 let me know if you need to change the size!

<br><br>

<b>PAGE BOY HAT: </b>lol no description required 😂 

<br><br>

<b>NATURE REPUBLIC:</b> hmm so i thought you can’t go wrong with face masks? i duno i just REALLY enjoy putting on face masks (even though i’ve been lazy) but i find them so relaxing lol. 


<br><br>
<b>GIFT CARD:</b>lol!!!! so i jokingly got this but i thought you would appreciate it haha. it’s for you to use on your starbucks app and for all your mocha needs 😂 hey the last time someone gave me a starbucks gift card i was actually really excited to treat myself every day lololol



<br><br>

<b>HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND I HOPE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME YEAR</b> ❤️ here’s to many more to come! (has it really been 7 years since we’ve met?!?! my goodness lol)
